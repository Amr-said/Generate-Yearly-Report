### 📥 Automatically downloads monthly reports from an internal system or web portal

### 📊 Consolidates all 12 months into a single yearly report using Excel automation

### 📁 Saves the final report in a designated folder with proper naming conventions

### ✅ Includes error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure robustness

🕒###  Saves hours of manual effort and eliminates the risk of human error
